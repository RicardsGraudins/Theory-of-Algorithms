# Theory of Algorithms
This repository contains course work completed as part of my course for the module **Theory of Algorithms**. The module is taught to undergraduate students at [GMIT](http://www.gmit.ie/) in the Department of Computer Science and Applied Physics for the course [B.S.c. (Hons) in Software Developement.](https://www.gmit.ie/software-development/bachelor-science-honours-software-development)
The lecturer is  [Dr. Ian McLoughlin](https://ianmcloughlin.github.io/).

## What is Racket:  
Racket is a general purpose, multi-paradigm programming language in the Lisp-Scheme family. One of its design goals is to serve as a platform for language creation, design, and implementation. The language is used in a variety of contexts such as scripting, general-purpose programming, computer science education, and research.
