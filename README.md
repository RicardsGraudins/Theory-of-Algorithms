# Theory of Algorithms
This repository contains course work completed as part of my course for the module **Theory of Algorithms**. The module is taught to undergraduate students at [GMIT](http://www.gmit.ie/) in the Department of Computer Science and Applied Physics for the course [B.S.c. (Hons) in Software Developement.](https://www.gmit.ie/software-development/bachelor-science-honours-software-development)
The lecturer is  [Dr. Ian McLoughlin](https://ianmcloughlin.github.io/).

## Functional Programming:
Functional programming is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects. Functional programming is declarative rather than imperative, and application state flows through pure functions. Contrast with object oriented programming, where application state is usually shared and colocated with methods in objects. Functional code tends to be more concise, more predictable, and easier to test than imperative or object oriented code however it has a steep learning curve and can be challenging to get into to.

## What is Racket:  
Racket is a general purpose, multi-paradigm programming language in the Lisp-Scheme family. One of its design goals is to serve as a platform for language creation, design, and implementation. The language is used in a variety of contexts such as scripting, general-purpose programming, computer science education, and research.

## Java Solutions:
All of the exercises will have an additional file called `runner.java ` which is essentially the exercise solution coded up using Java. I decided to code up the solution using a programming language that I am familiar with before attempting the task using Racket in order to get a more refined idea of the exercise and afterward to compare the two solutions in order to get a better understanding of functional programming.

## Overall Conclusion:
Since Racket was my first functional programming language, it was challenging enough to get into and some parts proved tricky e.g. getting the hang of lists/pairs. The Racket references at the bottom of this readme were extremely useful and informative while learning Racket and after tackling all of these exercises one after the other, in my opinion this module provided an ample introduction to the language.

## How to run:
1. Download the Racket IDE [here](https://download.racket-lang.org/).
2. Download this repository or clone `git clone https://github.com/RicardsGraudins/Theory-of-Algorithms`.
3. Open DrRacket and open any file ending with `.rkt`.
4. Run the code with `Ctrl R`.
